BindCraft-RunPod

Streamline Your Protein Engineering with automated cloud deployment and a user-friendly Interface. For detailed instructions on set-up please see this blog post.

Quick Start for Protein Engineers: For those eager to begin, I have developed a specialized tool to simplify your workflow. 

You can immediately access and utilize BindCraft with a pre-configured environment on RunPod (plus an intuitive GUI). This allows you to bypass complex setup and focus directly on your design tasks. Click here to try the BindCraft RunPod template: https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=sfpbu5gqqw&ref=tt816r6b


This repository is not a fork of the original BindCraft repo, but a repackaged, cloud-optimized version that:

	Runs in a RunPod container with a lightweight Docker image.

	PyRosetta and AF2 weights and PyRosetta are auto-installed after container mounting.
	
 	Offers a Jupyter-based GUI for editing targets and launching jobs

	Supports user-provided design inputs via mounted volumes


⚠️ This repo reuses key components from the original BindCraft repository (MIT License), including settings templates and backend logic. 

Full credit and detailed documentation for BindCraft is available at: https://github.com/martinpacesa/BindCraft Preprint


Quick Start on RunPod
Clone the latest development repository:

git clone -b dev https://github.com/A-Yarrow/bindcraft-runpod.git

cd bindcraft-runpod

Build and Push the Docker image:

docker build -t your-dockerhub-login-name/bindcraft-cloud:yourtag.

docker push your-dockerhub-login-name/bindcraft-cloud:yourtag

Choose an appropriate Cloud GPU. Alternatively, use my RunPod Template: https://console.runpod.io/deploy?template=sfpbu5gqqw&ref=tt816r6b

	This Template has been tested and works with RunPods: A100 SXM, H100 SXM, L40, L40S, RTX6000 ada

Open Jupyter: JupyterLab will be available on port 8888. Use these detailed  instructions to launch your first job.


Jupyter Notebook and GUI
A starter notebook bindcraft-runpod-start.ipynb is provided to:

	Help users mount settings and parameter folders

	Launch designs using bindcraft.py

	View outputs and logs

	Upload custom target files

	GUI Workflow

The user-friendly GUI treamlines the design process:

	Uploads:
	
 		Upload PDB or Create Target JSON:

		Upload a PDB file directly. The GUI will check for chain breaks and other inconsistencies.

		Alternatively, create a new target JSON file by filling in the required fields (design path, starting PDB, hotspot residues, binder lengths, and number of designs).

		Submit Job:

			Enter a unique job name.
			
   			Select the target JSON file from the dropdown menu.

			Click "Submit Job" to start the design process.

	Monitor Progress:

		Logs are stored in a subdirectory within the outputs folder, labeled with the job name.

Why I Built This

	As a protein design engineer, I needed a reproducible and cloud-friendly setup to:

	Run high-throughput binder design without local GPU constraints

	Use RunPod or other cloud GPU services with persistent state
	
 	Share a ready-to-use Docker image for others to reproduce my workflows

	This repo lets users skip complex local setup and run everything via a containerized workflow, while still preserving full flexibility of BindCraft’s powerful design stack.
